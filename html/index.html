        <i>Peaky Blinders</i> is a <b>British</b> crime TV series primarily set
        in Birmingham, England in the aftermath of World War I. <br />The
        fictional gang is loosely based on the Peaky Blinders, a real urban
        youth gang who were active in the city from the 1890s and early 20th
        century. <br />The dark, dramatic soundtrack is a window into the mind
        of Tommy - a tortured ex-soldier. Artists such as Nick Cave, Laura
        Marling, Johnny Cash, the White Stripes have written original songs for
        the show.
